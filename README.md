Testing with Python
===================

MATLAB's 2013b release brings `functiontests`, the first testing framework for MATLAB. Its highlights are outlined in a blog post by Loren, http://blogs.mathworks.com/loren/2013/10/15/function-is-as-functiontests/?s_eid=PSM_5863.

Python's unittest.py framework was part of its 2.1 release in 2001 and has since developed into a powerful yet simple toolkit for developing reliable code.

This repository essenentially reproduces Loren's ODE problem with some simple tests in Python.
